// command_processor.hpp — apply a decoded PM4 stream to a GPU state snapshot.
//
// This is the second CommandProcessor stage (after pm4_decode): walk the decoded ops and fold them
// into a `GpuState` — the register files (context/shader/user-config) plus index type and the list of
// draws. A later stage translates a GpuState + its draws into Vulkan pipelines/draw calls (M4).
//
// Register application matches Kyty's CommandProcessor (GraphicsRun.cpp `cp_op_indirect_cx_regs`,
// MIT): a Set{Cx,Sh,Uc}RegistersIndirect packet points at an array of `num_regs` {offset, value}
// pairs (a ShaderRegister[]); each writes `value` into the class's register file at `offset`. Because
// prosper maps the guest image 1:1, the packet's `regs_vaddr` is directly readable as a host pointer.

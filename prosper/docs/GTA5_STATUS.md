# Grand Theft Auto V (`PPSA04263`, RAGE) — status

**Rung 3** on the bring-up ladder: routed gameplay entry with real GPU draws. The HUD, radar and
tutorial text render; the 3D world does not.

Tracker: **#1873**. Active frontier: **#2481**. Route: `scripts/gta5/reach-story-mode.pad`
(read its header — the flip timing is measured, not estimated, and the tab navigation needs four R1
presses for a reason).

Historical design note for the descriptor work: `docs/FLAT_LOAD_DESIGN.md`. Do not start from it; the
descriptor-array lift it describes is complete.

## Where the world went

As of 2026-08-14 the black world is **one compute program**, and that is established by A/B rather
than inferred:

```
PROSPER_COMPUTE_SKIP_PROGRAM=0x413dc6700
```

| arm | device losses | frame |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | 1, at ~59 s — reproduced in every run | black + HUD |
| `0x413dc6700` skipped | **0** across a full 300 s route | sun, anamorphic lens flare, radar with street geometry and blips, first-person tutorial text |

`0x413dc6700` hangs the GPU into a RADV **hard recovery** at `queue-submit`. prosper then disables
live compute for the whole process, and every later dispatch and indirect draw in the frame is
refused — so the frame cannot recover even partially.

**Read that skipped-program frame carefully: it is not "the frame minus that dispatch".** A skip goes
through the same decline path as a real refusal, so it clears `producer_epoch_ok` and the next
`ParserStall` latches `indirect_dependencies_ok` for the rest of the submit. The frame is that frame
minus the dispatch *minus every indirect draw and dispatch after the next parser stall*. The zero
device losses and the appearance of real scene content are unaffected by this; what it costs is the
right to attribute the *remaining* blackness in that image to `0x413dc6700` alone.

What the program probably is, from what survives without it: 43 resources,
`threads=2063x1x1 local=256x1x1 groups=9x1x1`, 61,143 SPIR-V dwords, and sky/flare/radar render while
world geometry does not — the shape of a tiled deferred lighting or light-culling pass.

**The frontier is therefore exactly one sentence: `0x413dc6700` must execute without hanging.**

### Why this took so long to see

Until #2538 the live compute backend had **fifteen** `return false` paths in `execute_item()` that were
silent, `trace`-gated, or logged without naming the dispatch. The executor records such a refusal as
`RealizationFailureReason::Unknown`, and **only when a capture trace is active** — so on a default run
a refused dispatch left no record at all. (`ComputeExecutionDeclined`, which an earlier revision of
this file named, is a classification added later by #2536; it did not exist when the frame went
black.) A gameplay submit's 196 realization failures were 59 anonymous declines and 128 cascade
failures, and the cascade hid the cause:

1. a declined dispatch clears `producer_epoch_ok`
2. the next `ParserStall` latches `indirect_dependencies_ok` false for the **rest of the submit**
   (`gpu_executor.cpp:9609`)
3. every later indirect draw and indirect dispatch short-circuits to `IndirectDependencies` without
   being attempted (`:9354`, `:9422`)

GTA V's world is GPU-driven, so the indirect operations *are* the world. One refusal anywhere early in
a submit removes all of it. Several sessions went to the 72 **direct** draws that execute correctly at
3840x2160 with colour writes enabled — they were never the ones failing.

The first domino turned out to be an **empty guest kernel**: `0x413cea300`, whose entire body is one
`s_endpgm`, declared one raw buffer and was refused as `no-bindable-descriptor` 192+ times per run.
Fixed by proving emptiness from the raw stream (`rdna2_program_is_terminator_only`) and reporting such
a dispatch as a successful no-op. A/B: 192 declines to 0.

## Ruled out

One line per falsified hypothesis, the evidence that killed it, and where. **Read this before forming
a new one** — and note which entries are *solid* versus *void*, because a void result is not a
falsification.

- **The 72 direct draws are failing / are culled / have colour writes masked.** They execute at full
  3840x2160 with `effective=3f` and zero realization failures in the window that presents black. The
  world is drawn by *indirect* operations, which the latch above dropped untried. #2481.
- **Collapsed AABBs culling the world.** The reduction at `0x413ced900` computes a correct bounding
  box, `(-13.71, -23.65, 0)` to `(14.98, 16.95, 4.101)`. #2481.
- **`CB_TARGET_MASK=0` masking colour writes (the #1946 shape).** The main-view pass reports
  `effective=3f`. The pass that showed `target-mask=0 effective=00` was a **512x512 depth-only shadow
  atlas**, where that is correct — selected by a `MIN_DRAWS` filter, not by phase. Instrument trap 159.
- **The sky renders correctly offline and is lost live.** The `--draw-steps` composite that showed a
  blue gradient with a horizon band is prosper's **seed-miss placeholder**: already 100% non-black at
  step 4, before most draws run, and unchanged through step 78. Instrument trap 161.
- **The whole-frame abort on an unsupported storage image.** `render_draw_pass_rgba`
  (`tests/render_runner.h:3309`) does abandon an entire 4K frame on the first invalid storage-image
  contract, which is a real disproportionality — but gating it so only the offending draw is dropped
  left the black window unchanged. Reverted rather than landed. #2481.
- **A dark frame containing a dim scene.** Frames measuring 0.00% non-black at threshold 8/255 while
  12.7-13.5% of pixels are non-zero at luminance 1-2, with a CRC that changes every second, are
  **animated dither** — amplified 64x there is no structure, edge or geometry. Instrument trap 160.
- **The recompiler is the frontier.** `[compute] skip unsupported program` named 15 programs; retried
  offline against their own captured resource tables, **16 of 20 recompile cleanly**. Only 9 of 196
  failures in the classified capsule are `shader-recompile`. Instrument trap 157.
- **Unresolved descriptors on the hanging program.** All **43** of `0x413dc6700`'s resources resolve
  with real addresses and sizes; none is null. (The zero-address resources in an earlier dump belong to
  `0x413dc3400`, the neighbouring dispatch.) #2481.
- **The hang is an out-of-bounds write from a mis-sized buffer bound.** `RADV_DEBUG=hang` produced a
  report whose **`vm_fault.log` is 0 bytes** — no page fault, no VM fault. This was the leading
  suspect given #2529/#2535's history with `scalar_buffer_dword_count`. #2481.
- **The hang is a non-uniform `OpControlBarrier` deadlock.** The CFG dispatcher's continue block runs
  two workgroup-scope barriers per iteration and its LDS reduction covers only `[base..base+63]`,
  which looks exactly like a per-wave exit under a workgroup-wide barrier at `local=256`/`wave=64`.
  It is not: the loop-exit predicate reads **slot 260**, the whole-workgroup liveness result, so every
  invocation iterates together. #2481.
- **The hang is a non-uniform early exit.** The 14,370-line disassembled module contains exactly
  **one** `OpReturn`, at the end. No `OpKill`, none inside any of the three dispatcher loops. #2481.
- **A lost atomic corrupts the traversal table.** The table that hangs `0x413dc6700` is a linked list
  whose corruption is 61 **two-cycles** (`i` and `i+2` pointing at each other), the classic signature
  of a non-atomic concurrent insertion — two threads each linking to the other because both read the
  head before either wrote. Its producer `0x413ce3400` performs **no atomic operation of any kind**,
  and the strong form of that is structural rather than grep-shaped: its entire memory footprint is
  **29 buffer loads and stores** (`buffer_load_dword` x15, `buffer_load_dwordx2` x9,
  `buffer_store_dword` x4, `buffer_store_dwordx3` x1) and **zero `ds_*` instructions**, so there is no
  LDS family in which an atomic could hide. Zero `OpAtomic*` in its 3,881-line recompiled SPIR-V
  agrees. **Positive control, a different program in a different capsule**: `0x413ced900` contains
  `buffer_atomic_fmax` x3, `buffer_atomic_fmin` x3, `ds_max_f32` x3 and `ds_min_f32` x3 — so the
  instrument fires on the buffer family *and* the LDS family, and the zero is a real negative.
  **Note what the control also demonstrates:** a `(buffer|global|flat|ds)_atomic_*` pattern silently
  misses LDS atomics entirely, because RDNA2 spells them `ds_max_f32`, not `ds_atomic_max` — the
  control's own `ds_min/max_f32` would not have been found by it. That gap is why the claim above
  rests on the absence of the whole DS family rather than on an atomic-shaped pattern. #2542.
- **The producer/consumer ordering violation is `WAIT_REG_MEM` being barreled through.** The guest
  issues waits prosper cannot satisfy (`[agc] WaitRegMem … dependency violated … LABEL-UNMAPPED`, 40
  per route), and by default an unsatisfied wait does not pause the queue — which would let a
  consumer run before its producer's results land, exactly the symptom. **Falsified** with the
  opt-in barrier model `PROSPER_WAIT_DEFER=1` (#312): the device is still lost, at the same program
  and the same dispatch index. **Lever verified before reading the result** (instrument trap 164):
  the run logs 40 `pausing queue (deferred effects)` and the baseline logs 0, against 28 and 40
  `dependency violated` respectively, so the model was genuinely active. Note the recorded #312
  verdict against defaulting this ON was measured entirely on *Dragon Quest VII*'s heap corruption
  and says nothing about GTA V — this is an independent falsification, not a re-derivation of it.
  #2542.
- **The hang is an unconditionally infinite loop.** The same program executes successfully at dispatch
  38 and hangs at dispatch 39 of the same submit. Whatever spins is data-dependent. #2481.
- **Bounding the CFG dispatcher's trip count stops the hang.** Tried at 4096 and at 2^20; the device
  was lost both times. Note this cuts *against* the loop being unbounded rather than for it. #2481.

### Void, not falsified — do not cite these as settled

- **Portable wave64 emulation cost is the hang's mechanism.** A run with
  `PROSPER_NATIVE_COMPUTE_MULTIWAVE=1` still hung, which was reported as a falsification and **is
  not one**: the emitted module is **byte-identical** with and without the switch
  (`d04fd09b13408f9b4da7287fae34f692` in both arms and in a capsule from hours earlier), so the two
  runs are the same run. `[subgroup] … native=64 … multiwave=1` reports the resolved *config*, not the
  emitted lowering. The hypothesis is neither confirmed nor refuted — though it is now less likely on
  other grounds, since `native_subgroup_size` was apparently already 64, which suggests those barriers
  are the guest's own `s_barrier`s rather than emulation scaffolding. Reopening it needs a lever
  verified by module hash **before** its result is read. #2481.

## The 183-cycle measurement is real but its PROVENANCE is not — read this before building on it

Two facts that only make sense together, and their conflict is the most useful thing known about this
defect.

**Every start index is used.** The consumer's walk begins at `v1 = v68`, and `v68 = (s2 << 8) + v0`
(`pc1`), i.e. the global thread index; `pc74`'s `v_cmpx_gt_i32_e32 s18, v68` masks it to `< 2063`. So
threads 0..2062 walk the chain from their own index — **all 2063 starts, no exceptions**. The
cycle census over every start index is therefore exactly the right measurement, and any cycle in the
table is fatal rather than unreachable arena garbage. (This also kills the tempting hypothesis that
the starts are wrong and the table is fine: the starts are the thread index, and cannot be wrong.)

**But `compute[37]` completed on that table.** `compute[37]` (source 38, order 16836) is recorded as
executed, and the hang is `source 39` at order 16841 with no operation between them. Both bind the
same base. If the snapshotted table has 183 cyclic starts and every start is walked, source 38 must
have hung too. It did not.

**So the capsule's resource snapshot for `compute[37]` is not what `compute[37]` read.** The buffer is
rebuilt many times per run (below), so a snapshot taken at realization can lag or lead the bytes the
GPU actually consumed. That does not make the 183 cycles imaginary — the hang needs a cycle and
nothing else explains it — but it does mean **the cycle count cannot currently be attributed to a
specific dispatch**, and the live-vs-offline comparison built on it inherits that weakness.

Establishing snapshot provenance — when the capture reads a compute resource relative to the dispatch
that consumes it — is the prerequisite for any further work on this defect. Without it, every number
in this section is a measurement of an unknown moment.

## The traversal table is rebuilt many times per run — compare only WITHIN one capsule

Measured live with `PROSPER_COMPUTELOG_CODE=0x413ce3400` over a 120 s route: `0x413ce3400` writes
`0x20f848a240` **at least 20 times**, each write changing 10,000-14,000 of the 16,508 bytes and
producing a different content hash. One of those writes lands on `9c8a80d289972043` — the exact hash
the offline replay produces — and the others do not.

So the buffer is a **per-frame structure**, not a stable one, and two consequences follow:

- **A cross-run or cross-frame comparison of this table proves nothing.** Two hashes differing is the
  normal case. The only valid comparison is within one capsule: the same submit's recorded
  pre-producer, pre-consumer and offline-replayed states.
- **The write-back is not missing.** An earlier framing of the defect as "the producer's result never
  reaches the consumer" was reached before this was known. The write-back happens, changes ~11,000
  bytes, and its first dwords (`0, 0x18, 0x40000018, 0x38, …`) match the offline-correct shape rather
  than the cyclic one.

What survives that correction, because it is a within-capsule measurement: in `cap-cls2`'s single
submit, the live consumer's input contains **183 cyclic start indices** while the offline replay of
that same submit's prefix produces **0**, and the two differ by 2,355 of 8,252 bytes.

## Other open defects

- **#2445** — specific lowercase glyphs (`r`, `s`, `m`) dropped from UI text: "Ente ing Sto y Mode".
  Surrounding text is intact, so it is per-glyph, not a font failure.
- **#2429** — the world cannot render on 32-wide devices: the EXEC-population-count fix requires
  `native_subgroup_size == wave_size == 64`.
- **#2428** (Windows) — frame-rate cliffs of ~60x (62 fps to 0.8 fps) within 60 frames at the gameplay
  transition.
- **#2424** (Windows) — `sceKernelBatchMap` `MAP_DIRECT` fails `ENOMEM` on a
  map-small/unmap/map-larger cycle. No Linux equivalent.

## Instruments worth knowing about here

- **`PROSPER_COMPUTE_SKIP_PROGRAM=0xADDR[,...]`** — decline named compute programs. A bisection tool,
  not a workaround. It announces itself at parse time and reports each skip through the decline census
  as `reason=skipped-by-selector`, so a diagnostic run can never be mistaken for a default one later.
  Ordered **after** the trace and SPIR-V dump, so "dump the module, skip the dispatch" works — which
  is how a recompiler change can be checked against a program that hangs the GPU, at zero device cost.
- **`[compute-decline]`** — every refusal in `execute_item` now names its reason, the dispatch, and a
  **running count**. The count is in the line deliberately: rate-limited diagnostics in this codebase
  have twice been read as censuses.
- **`PROSPER_SUBGROUP_LOG`** — the resolved native-subgroup contract. Read it as an *input*: it says
  what the config resolved to, not what the emitter produced.
- **`RADV_DEBUG=hang`** — the vendor tool, no prosper change needed. Writes a report to
  `~/radv_dumps_<pid>_<ts>` with `vm_fault.log`, `trace.log` (the last CP trace point) and
  `pipeline.log` (shader stats for the hung pipeline). `umr` is not installed here, so per-wave PCs
  are unavailable, and `DISASM` needs an additional RADV flag.

## Shared-GPU policy on this title

Every device-loss experiment here costs a hard recovery on a machine other agents are using. Allow at
most **one expected device loss per hypothesis**, stop that process immediately after the loss, and
investigate before the next routed run. `PROSPER_COMPUTE_SKIP_PROGRAM` plus the SPIR-V dump removes
the need for most of them.
